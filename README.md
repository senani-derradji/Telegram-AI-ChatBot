# Using and Create
```python
if you want to put your personal bot and openai_api_key and run the bot directly just follow this steps :
> open chatBot/const.py
> replace my telegram bot api token by your bot api token and the same thing with openai api token and SAVE it
> open chatBot/main.py 
> delete the all information of ''' Derradji Bot '''
> delete the # from #openai.api_key = cs.openai_api_token()
```
#
# Some Explain
```bash
you will see some modules like dotenv and functions like getenv()
the target from this module and this function is the privacy when you want to publish your key's
like openai-api-key with your project you need to secure it by create .env file and use the function getenv("api-key")
that's it , i hope you like my project , thank you ^_^
